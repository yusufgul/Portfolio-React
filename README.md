# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project that I created for myself. I wanted to reflect my love towards the sky to this project, and I intend to continue developing it in the future.</br></br>This project was made with React.js and Tailwind.
```diff
I recommend using Chrome or another Chromium-based browser. The background of this 
project is somewhat heavy to render, and Firefox doesn't seem to be doing great with it. 
```

## Demo Link
https://portfolio-9defb.web.app/

## Features
- Starry sky for background created using canvas.
  - Background rotates slowly but only on bigger screens since older mobile devices have a hard time handling it. 
  - Sky also only rotates at the homepage, because I quickly relaized that trying to read something while the background is spinning can be dizzying. So, it only rotates on the homepage and on big screens.
- Displayed projects are not hard-coded. They are getting fetched from Firebase - Firestore Database. So, it can be updated easily.
- For handling contact form, [Getform.io](https://getform.io/) is used. Getform.io is a powerful form backend for HTML web forms.
- Responsive design for screens of any size.
